# The History of Bored Goth Central

The following sections (all except "The End of BGC") are taken from a
biography page I wrote for myself in late 1998. I'm leaving them
intact because I really don't have any recollection of this stuff
anymore, so this is as truthful as it's going to get.

## Early 1996

It all started on January 02, 1996. I had just gotten a small text
file on how to make webpages, and I had played with PSP before, so I
decided since it was christmas break and I had nothing better to do,
I'd make a homepage. Using a Cure CD (Pornography, I think it was) to
generate some images with [Cthugha][7] (I LOVE THIS PROGRAM, it's
still around today, the ultimate trip toy), I then pasted them into
Paint Shop Pro and just wrote stuff over them, as can be seen in the
picture to the left. I basically did the same thing with the
background ([Cthugha][7] actually tiles really well, kinda weird) and
all of the other 2 or 3 graphics I put on the page. There wasn't much
content for the page for about 2 months because I was still learning
HTML, but in March, things begin to happen.

## Mid 1996

I finally got the urge to add something more then just personal
information to the page. Since I was into the whole gothy thing (IE I
owned cleopatra stuff), I decided to make a little Gothic page. At
first, it just contained what every other single gothic page, even
today, contains. A few pictures of myself and links to the bands I
liked. And absolutly nothing else. Needless to say, like all other
pages of it's genre, it sucked. Really bad. It got about 5 hits the
whole month, mostly from me looking at it so I could update it and
that sort of thing. I eventually got bored with it in about mid March
and nothing happened until mid-april.

So, I was going through various webpages, and was beginning to notice
that just about every other page looked exactly like mine. And this
was really fucking boring. The only really interesting pages around
then were [VampLestat's server][10], [Darkside of the Web][9], Aircrash Monthly,
and [Peter Caffin's gothcode][8], which had just recently come out. So
therefore, since the majority of gothic pages seemed to be boring, I
thought I'd get fancy and create "The Gothic Boredom Relief
Page". This is the first glimpse of Bored Goth Central as everyone
knows it today. The first two things this page contained were the
Gothic Hangman game and a promise of a page that would revolutionize
the web, the GOTHCODE ENCODER page, the vaporware page that made me
famous.

## Late 1996

<CENTER markdown='1'>![Bored Goth Central][4]</CENTER>

Well, I got Hangman up and running, and began on the task of writing
the Gothcode Encoder page. Then I came upon the small problem of not
being able to code Perl, or CGI, or even good HTML for that
matter. Even so, I still coded the form for the encoder, in one whole
damn page that took up about 90k. Then I stopped. And promptly forgot
about the page. Unfortunatly for me, word got around about the page
and I started getting lots of mail from people anticipating a way to
make goth codes without having to sit down and translate the form, a
task which could take hours sometimes. But, even from bitching and
whining, nothing came. About this time I started to think of other
ideas too. In late May, the name change happened, due to the fact that
"The Gothic Boredom Relief Page" was just a mouthful to say as well as
to type out. What you see here is the first BORED GOTH CENTRAL graphic
to come up, which I thought looked awful spiffy 'cause I'd just gotten
PS 3.0 and was loving it. In reality, no one could read the graphic
and I finally had to change it. Ah well. The Gothic Tape Trade was
begun about this time (with more Cthugha driven graphics. I broke
soooo many copyright laws I'm sure. ;) ), as well as the #gothic page
(never ever run a #gothic page. Ever.)... I also started Bored Goth
Gallery, a place to keep what few pictures I had of my friends and
I. Now we're to about winter of the 1996-97 year, and I give up the
webpage for a while due to personal problems. So, time skip again,
kids.

## Early 1997

<CENTER markdown='1'>![Bored Goth Central][5]</CENTER>

Fast forward lots. Mainly up to May of 1997. Not much really
happening, the page is now made up of Gothic Tape Trade and Bored Goth
Gallery. I'd tried running other pages (Gothic Word of the Extended
Period of Time, gothic Dance studio, ect..), but all of them had
failed due to lack of interest. Then came the Gothic Scouts. May 5th,
1997, I got drunk. Really drunk. And Subgirl and I were talking about
the Girl Scouts, and made the Gothic scouts just out of sheer
sillyness. One month after putting the initial page up, we started
accepting members. This is when things started to take off. As of
early August, we had about 250 or so members in the Gothic Scouts,
which all of the founders were mildly surprised at. Then, the
biggun. Weaselboy invited BGC to move to gothic.net, the new gothic
based server he was going to put up. Currently the only other page on
it was Carrie Carolin's Dark side of the Web, basically THE gothic
site. After my initial joygasm, we moved to Gothic.net, and life
became wonderful.

## Mid 1997 - 1998

<CENTER markdown='1'>![Bored Goth Central][6]</CENTER>

So, now life becomes more and more movie like. September, I start
gothic crackwhore, what has been by FAR my most looked at page so far,
and probably the one I'm happiest with for content, just because I get
to use my own wit as well as getting to experience others. Not to
mention we got to feature Poppy Z. Brite one week. Not many new pages
came up after this, due to the sheer mass I've had to take care of
ever since. In february BGC made it in "The Web" TV show on the Sci-Fi
channel along with quite a few other sites from Gothic.net, and the
Gothic Scouts broke 1000 members in April of 1998. Now as of July
1998, we are finally starting to do new projects again (like this
one), and Bored Goth Central is going to new heights. And no, the
GothCode encoder is STILL NOT FINISHED. :)

# The End

Bored Goth Central lasted through early 1999, mostly dying out due to
lack of upkeep time while I was busy with college and new job. After
leaving gothic.net (also around that time), it was just too much work
to keep things updated. The page stayed live until the point that the
Gothic Scouts became the last surviving projects and moved to another
domain. BGC was then taken down and the url operated as various
versions of my homepage until the move to numberporn.com.
